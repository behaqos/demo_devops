# DevOps Configuration Examples

This project provides configuration examples for installing and managing a set of commonly used software tools for DevOps environments:

- PostgreSQL
- GitLab
- Grafana
- Prometheus
- Nginx

## Configuration Parts

The configurations are provided in three parts:

1. Clear server installations
2. Docker-Compose configurations
3. Kubernetes configurations (work in progress)

## Software Tools

### PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system that is widely used in DevOps environments for storing and managing application data.

### GitLab

A web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management, continuous integration, and continuous deployment services. It is a popular choice for DevOps teams looking to streamline their development workflows.

### Grafana

A popular open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring. It can be used to visualize and analyze a wide range of metrics, such as application performance, server health, and network traffic.

### Prometheus

A powerful open-source monitoring system that is widely used in DevOps environments for collecting and analyzing metrics from various sources. It is known for its scalability, reliability, and ease of use.

### Nginx

A high-performance web server and reverse proxy that is commonly used in DevOps environments to serve static and dynamic content, handle SSL/TLS encryption, and load-balance incoming traffic.

## Usage

Practically all configurations are tested and ready to use, and can be easily adapted to suit specific use cases. The project also includes documentation on best practices for deploying and managing each software tool, as well as troubleshooting tips.
