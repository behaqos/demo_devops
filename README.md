# DevOps Configuration Examples

This repository provides configuration examples for installing and managing a set of commonly used software tools for DevOps environments. The configurations are designed to be simple, flexible, and easy to use.

## Software Tools

The following software tools are included in this repository:

### PostgreSQL

An open-source relational database management system that is widely used in DevOps environments for storing and managing application data.

## Configurations

The configurations are provided in three parts:

1. Clear server installations: This part includes instructions and scripts for installing each software tool directly on a server. It provides a clear, step-by-step guide to setting up the necessary system dependencies and configuring each tool to run on a server.

2. Docker-Compose configurations: This part includes instructions and files for deploying each software tool as a container using Docker Compose. It provides a simple and flexible way to run the tools in a containerized environment, making it easy to deploy and scale applications.

3. Kubernetes configurations (work in progress): This part will include instructions and files for deploying each software tool as a container using Kubernetes. It will provide a more advanced way to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes.

<!-- ## Documentation

The project also includes documentation on best practices for deploying and managing each software tool, as well as troubleshooting tips. You can find this documentation in the `docs` directory of the repository. -->
